This is [Sourabh](http://sourabhbajaj.com), a software engineer on the Analytics team at Coursera. Prior to Coursera I was a student at Georgia Tech and BITS Pilani. In my free time I try to learn something, contribute to open source and go hiking.

Tweet at [@sb2nov](http://twitter.com/sb2nov) and read my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/sb2nov).
