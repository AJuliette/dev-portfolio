      <p>Hi, I am Sourabh. I'm an engineer interested in distributed data processing and machine learning.</p>

      <p>I currently work at Google on <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/">Cloud Dataflow</a>. Prior to Google I worked at <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> working on data infrastructure and data products. I'm also a Georgia Tech and BITS Pilani alumni. I was once the TA for the computational investing MOOC on Coursera.</p>

      <p>In my free time I try to learn something, contribute to open source and go hiking.</p>
