      <p>I am Sourabh, an engineer interested in machine learning and distributed systems.</p>

      <p>At <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> I currently work on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Tensorflow</a> and Tensor Processing Units (TPU). Before that I was involved in data processing using <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/">Cloud Dataflow</a>.</p>

      <p>Prior to Google I was at <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a> working on data infrastructure and data products. I'm also a Georgia Tech and BITS Pilani alumni. I was once the TA for a machine learning MOOC on Coursera.</p>

      <p>In my free time I try to learn something, contribute to open source and go hiking.</p>
